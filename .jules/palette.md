## 2025-06-02 - Added Focus Visible State to Tabs Component
**Learning:** Custom tab implementations often handle keydown events manually to navigate between tabs, but frequently overlook the need for a distinct visual focus indicator (`:focus-visible`) on the tab elements themselves, making keyboard navigation difficult to track visually.
**Action:** Always ensure that any custom interactive element that can receive keyboard focus (like tabs, custom buttons, or toggle switches) has a clear `:focus-visible` outline applied in CSS.
